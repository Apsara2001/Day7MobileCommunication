React Parent-Child Communication

This repository demonstrates a simple React application showcasing "parent-to-child and ""child-to-parent" communication using "props" and "state".

Overview

The project consists of:
  A "Parent Component (App)" that maintains state and passes a function to the child component.
  A "Child Component (Childcom)" that calls the function received from the parent to update the parent's state.
